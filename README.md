**Tap Rpc** is a tool that aids in proto based dynamic generation of **mock server**, real time **request/response editor** and provides **client** to significantly speed up work for all of frontend, backend and testers.

## Features

### **Tap Rpc** provides 3 modes of operation :

### **Mock Rpc** mode :

- Automatically setup mock response server by loading proto file
- Generates convincing mock responses based on the properties in the proto
- Supports loading multiple proto files with multiple services and rpcs
- Edit values of generated mock responses based on your need

### **Monitor** mode :

- Monitor requests and responses by acting as the middle man between a grpc client and server
- Edit requests in real time before it reaches the backend server
- Edit response in real time before it reaches back the client

### **Client** mode :
- Test your backend services independently with this client
- Generates convincing Mock Request objects for quick rpc calls
