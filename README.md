**Tap Rpc** is a tool that aids in proto based dynamic generation of : 
- A **mock server** that sends realistic auto generated mock responses (which can be customized).
- **Realtime modification of request and responses**. Modify requests from client before it reaches server and modify response from server before it reaches client.
- Provides grpc **client** to send auto generated mock requests to your services.

Tap-Rpc aims to significantly ease the development and testing efforts for all of frontend, backend devs and also testers.

## üîñüìë [Read the Medium Article on TAP-RPC here](https://medium.com/geekculture/complete-your-grpc-development-and-testing-workflow-with-tap-rpc-bc185a1adce5) ‚ú®

## Installation and Usage :

- Download the latest release from here : https://github.com/nateshmbhat/tap-rpc/releases

- In your client app, set the host and port for the grpc service to point to the Tap-Rpc‚Äôs ip address and port shown at the middle of the Tap-Rpc window title.
- Set the default target server URL, which is needed for the monitor and client modes.
- User selects the proto files containing the services. Once you select proto files, all the services and Rpcs in those services appear in a tree structure and you can select a particular rpc.
- At this point any requests coming from the client will be forwarded to the default target server in the background.
- Now your client app is ready to access all the features of Tap-Rpc.


## Features

### **Tap Rpc** provides 3 modes of operation :

### **Mock Rpc** mode :

- Automatically setup mock response server by loading proto file
- Generates convincing mock responses based on the properties in the proto
- Supports loading multiple proto files with multiple services and rpcs
- Edit values of generated mock responses based on your need

### **Monitor** mode :

- Monitor requests and responses by acting as the middle man between a grpc client and server
- Edit requests in real time before it reaches the backend server
- Edit response in real time before it reaches back the client

### **Client** mode :
- Test your backend services independently with this client
- Generates convincing Mock Request objects for quick rpc calls
